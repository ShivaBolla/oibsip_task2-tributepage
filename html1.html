         <h3S>Shivaji Shahaji Bhonsale; Marathi pronunciation:c.was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle
        Maratha clan.Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi sultanate
        of Bapur which formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. In 1674,he was formally crowned the 
        Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.
        Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the 
        Sultanate of
        Golkonda, Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha
        sphere 
        of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. Shivaji established a competent and
        progressive
        civil rule with well-structured administrative organisations. He revived ancient Hindu political traditions,
        court
        conventions and promoted the usage of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian in court and
        administration.
        Praised for his chivalrous treatment of women,Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including
        Muslims and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.Opinions about Shivaji have varied by observer
        and time, but nearly two centuries after his death, he began to take on increased importance with the emergence
        of the Indian independence movement, as many Indian nationalists elevated him 
        as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus</h3>
